### Technologies Used  

This project uses:
* JavaScript
* Tone.js
* HTML
* CSS

### Future Features

Things that could be added would be using the keyboard to play the instrument.  Also, creating custom oscillators with filters and effects that the user can use to create sounds instead of the stock Polysynth tone from the library would be a great feature too.  Maybe the user will be able to save presets as well?  There are a lot of options!.
